Check out the site I made! To use it, just input a Twitch streamer into the
search bar at the top of the screen. 

The whole purpose of the website is to see if a Twitch streamer is online 
without having to actually log onto Twitch.

It is still a work in progress. 

### To run the flask file, do these commands

```
. venv/bin/activate
export FLASK_APP=twitterAPI.py
flask run
```
